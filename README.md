# Millennial Falcon

## Description

Millennial Falcon creates internet-age resources that will enable humans to easily understand and understand the financial strategies of America’s wealthiest 1%. Along with allowing users to algorithmically map a lifetime view of their own debts, expenses, income, and budget strategy, millennialfalcon.co will also estimate what investing in stocks, Roth and traditional 401Ks and IRAs, life insurance and trusts would look like based on the user’s current financial situation.

Millennial Falcon is revolutionizing the way society understands income and outcome (expenses). Financial planning is no longer an inaccessible tool for the wealthy; millennialfalcon.co creates free financial strategy tools that provide a dashboard to navigate the user’s financial lifetime, all calculations are estimated by the information the user has provided online. Once the user understands their current financial situation, they will then be shown the strategies of the 1%’s various financial mediums and then understand the ensuing need to strategically plan their own financial future.

Whether helping generations ravaged by debt, revolutionizing day-to-day personal financial practices, or planning the sustainable financial futures of generations to come, Millennial Falcon hopes to be a socially responsible, environmentally aware, organicly creative website that not only plans for the here and now, but for of there and then.
